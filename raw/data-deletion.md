1. Purpose

This Data Deletion Policy explains how users of the OneDrop app (‚Äúthe App,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) can request deletion of their personal data and what happens to that data once deleted.
We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how your data is handled and erased.

2. How Users Can Delete Their Data

You can permanently delete your account and all associated data directly from the app:

Delete Account ‚Üí Removes your general user profile, contact number, and authentication data.

Delete Donor Account ‚Üí Removes all blood donor‚Äìrelated information, including name, age, gender, blood group, and location.

Once a user confirms deletion through these options, all related data is immediately and permanently removed from our servers and databases.

3. What Data Gets Deleted

Upon successful deletion, the following categories of personal data are erased:

Name, phone number, and user ID

Age, gender, and blood group

Donor listing details (including location and visibility status)

Communication history or donor availability records

Authentication tokens or session data

No residual copies are stored in backups or logs beyond 72 hours (for technical sync and server maintenance).

4. What Data Is Retained (If Any)

We may retain minimal, non-identifiable metadata for security auditing and fraud prevention, such as:

Account deletion timestamp

Country/region of deletion request

These records do not contain any personal or contact information and are used strictly to ensure system integrity.

5. Third-Party Data Handling

The OneDrop app uses Google AdMob for displaying banner ads.
While we do not directly share any user data with advertisers, AdMob may collect limited, anonymized device data (e.g., ad performance metrics, approximate location) per Google‚Äôs Privacy Policy.

We do not sell, rent, or share user data with any other third parties.
